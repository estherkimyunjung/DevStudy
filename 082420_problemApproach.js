//Algorithm a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
//1. devise a plan for the solving problems
//2. Master common problem solving patterns

// PROBLEMS SOLVING
// 1. Understand the problems 
//  - can I restate the problem in my own word?
//  - what are the input that go into the problem?
//  - what are the output that should come from the solution to the problem?
//  - can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to the slove problem?
//  - How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
// 2. Explore concrete examples (user stories and unit tests)
//  - Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
//  - Example also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should
// 3. Break it down
//  - 
// 4. Solve/Simplify
// 5. Look back and refactor
