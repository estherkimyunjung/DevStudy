## Introduction to Object-Orientation

> **Object-oriented programming (OOP)** is a type of programming based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). OOP is all about being able to structure code so that its functionality can be shared throughout the application. This is opposed to procedural programming (PP), in which you build programs in sequential order and call methods when you want shared behavior between pages in the application.
