2.) Do a React tutorial to refresh the basics;
3.) Learn about the differences between a functional and a class component;
4.) Learn to develop functional components;
5.) Learn to leverage ternaries to toggle inline styles and classNames. Watch videos on Frontend Masters [https://frontendmasters.com/] to learn techniques from industry professionals. Other resources: Check out "Cracking the Coding Interview" (McDowell) to review computer science fundamentals, including data structures, sorting algorithms, and time complexity/Big O Notation.

1. JavaScript questions that I asked during the mock interview:
   -- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
   -- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
   What is the difference between an object and an array?
   What type of data structure is a stack? (LIFO)
   What type of data structure is a queue? (FIFO)
   What kind of data structure is a DOM? (Tree)
   What is the difference between map and foreach in JavaScript?
   What is hoisting?

2. Additional JavaScript questions that you should look up on Google:
   How would you emulate a stack in JavaScript?
   How would you emulate a queue in JavaScript?
   If the DOM has n nodes, and is a balanced binary tree, how long does it take to traverse the DOM?
   What is event delegation in JavaScript?
   What is the difference between apply and call in JavaScript?
   Explain how event propagation works in JavaScript. Give an example.

3. Videos to deepen front-end knowledge:

4. Many large companies (e.g., Dropbox, Pinterest, Amazon) provide Software Engineer Apprenticeship Programs. Try checking out their programs and see what kinds of skills they are looking for. These programs may not be as rigorous about interviewing your algorithmic or "deep" JavaScript knowledge; they can also help you get your foot more easily in the door.
